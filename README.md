## Surrender

A pure-go non-antialiased TinySVG 1.2 renderer created with some help from GPT4.

The goal is to be able to render TinySVG 1.2 files.

Currently supported elements (sorta):

* svg
* path (some of it)
* circle
* rect

## TODO

- [ ] Be able to render SVG images that are produced by [png2svg](https://github.com/xyproto/png2svg).
- [ ] Be able to render `g` elements.
