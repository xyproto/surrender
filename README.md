# ! THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS !

## Surrender

The early beginnings of a pure-go non-antialiased TinySVG 1.2 renderer.

The goal is to be able to render TinySVG 1.2 files.

Currently supported elements (sorta):

* svg
* path (some of it)
* circle
* rect

## TODO

- [x] Be able to render SVG images that are produced by [png2svg](https://github.com/xyproto/png2svg).
- [x] Be able to render `g` elements.
- [ ] More robust path data and coordinate parsing.

## General info

* Version: -0.-0.-0
